! This is an example key remapping file that goes with KEY200.
! (If you run KEY200 without any arguments, some terse help is printed.)
!
! There are various example key definitions in here; use them as a guide
! to how you can customize your 200 to work the way you want to.
!

! ---------
! EXAMPLE 1 : Swap the Memo and Notetaker keys, so Notetaker is a primary key
! ---------

Ctrl Memo : ^Ctrl Ctrl ^Ctrl Memo ^Memo
Memo      : Ctrl Memo ^Memo ^Ctrl

! Here the Memo key will bring up Notetaker, and vice versa.  Notice that
! 1) The Ctrl Memo definition is before the Memo definition (by putting
!    the more specific Memo definition first, it ensures both will work
!    correctly.
! 2) Both key presses (Ctrl Memo) and key releases (^Memo ^Ctrl) are
!    included--KEY200 requires key presses AND key releases.
! 3) Although the Memo key remapping is easy, the Ctrl Memo key
!    requires a little explanation.  The first ^Ctrl releases the Ctrl
!    key (since it is already being held down at the time Ctrl Memo is
!    recognized).  The next Ctrl ^Ctrl section is really only needed for
!    KEYBEZ--if KEYBEZ is loaded, a solo Ctrl press and release switches
!    bilingual keyboards.  The Ctrl ^Ctrl switches the keyboard back
!    to what it was before the Ctrl+Memo was started.  Then, the Memo
!    key is pressed and released.

! EXAMPLE 2 : Using the MENU key to open up room for keyboard macros
! ---------

Menu e : e ^e x ^x a ^a m ^m p ^p l ^l e ^e    ! Types "example"
Menu r : Ctrl Alt Del                          ! Menu R for rebooting
Menu t : Ctrl Phone ^Phone ^Ctrl F9 ^F9 A Shift ; ^Shift \ T U N E S  F10
                                               ! Menu T = Load tunes database

Menu ^Menu : Alt ^Alt    ! Now, only a solo Menu press brings up menu
Menu :      ! Nothing as a definition allows us to null out Menu Press
^Menu :     ! Don't let menu release do anything by itself, either

! These four lines reconfigure the Menu key to provide potentially
! many macros on the Menu key.  The first three are just some examples
! of keys you might define.
!    Useful things to note here are that the Menu E example types
! "example" the safe way, by including all keypresses and releases. This
! is exactly how it would look to a program if you typed it in yourself, and
! will always work.  The Menu T example loads up a preset database into the
! database application.  This "cheats", since the key releases aren't included.
! For almost all programs, this should work just fine for letters and numbers.
! (Note that the ':' in the filename was typed by Shift+';', just like on
!  a standard PC.)
!
! The last three lines redefine how the Menu key works.
! The first reconfigures the menu key to be an Alt key. This does two things:
!   1) it makes the menu react on *releasing* the menu key.
!   2) it allows the menu key to toggle the menu on/off (like Alt does).
! The following two macros cause the Menu press (which would normally
! bring up the menu), and the menu release to do nothing.


! ---------
! EXAMPLE 3 : Double key press
! ---------

^More More : More ^More Menu ^Menu A ^A T ^T Enter ^Enter   ! Leave the SysMgr
^Filer Filer : 2 ^2 0 ^0 0 ^0 Enter ^Enter                  ! Restart SysMgr

! This allows a double click (a More key press & release, followed by
! another More key press with no intervening keystrokes) to terminate the
! System Manager.
! The corresponding action to get back into the System Manager is a "double
! click" on the Filer key.
!
! Note that this technique really works best on the applications keys,
! since two keypresses in a row is normally invalid for the application keys.

! OTHER NOTES
! -----------
!   * To install KEY200, include a line like:
!          KEY200 MYKEYS.TXT
!     in your AUTOEXEC.BAT, before the 200 command.
!
!   * To uninstall KEY200, just type KEY200 after it has already been loaded.
!
!   * The key sequences on the right side of definitions are unaffected by
!     your other remappings.  That is, even if you've redefined Phone to do
!     something else, Phone in a definition will still bring up the Phonebook.
!
!   * To speed up key processing, remove all comments from your definition
!     file.
!
!   * The following key sequences are not reproducible with KEY200:
!      ON +, ON -, ON *, ON /, ON =, MENU Arrows, FN Zoom
!
!   * Although a definition is provided for the ZOOM key, it will only work
!     within the applications, not from within DOS.
!
!   * When reproducing keys that are shifted, use the PC equivalent
!     key sequence, not the 200LX key sequence.  For example, to create
!     a '<', use:
!        Shift , ^, ^Shift
!     NOT
!        Shift 1 ^1 ^Shift
!
