Printing to a File in MEMO, getting escape sequences

The escape sequences you get when printing to a file are as a result of
the Bold/Underline features of Memo (in conjunction with the Header/Footer
features).  There's not much you can do to get rid of them. That's the bad
news.

The good news is that there MAY be something you can do to get rid of them, as
long as you're NOT using bold,underline, headers, or footers.  The MEMOED.ENV
file contains a number of things, FOUR of which are 32-byte buffers which are
normally 0-filled, but if you place a null-terminated string in one or more of
these buffers, then whatever string you place there will OVERRIDE the default
escape sequences sent to the printer for BOLD ON, BOLD OFF, UNDERLINE ON, and
UNDERLINE OFF.  So, if you're not using bold/underline, simply placing a SPACE
character into the first byte of each of those fields SHOULD get rid of those
escape sequences.  The format (contents) of the MEMOED.ENV file are shown
below.

NOTE!!!! This is NOT supported and MAY change at moments notice in a
future revision of the ROMs.

        MemoFlags         2 bytes
        unused            2 bytes
        CurrentFont       2 bytes
        RowSpacing        2 bytes
        MainFlags         2 bytes
        AutoSave          2 bytes
        CursorBlink       2 bytes
        TopMargin         2 bytes
        BottomMargin      2 bytes
        LinesPerPage      2 bytes
        LastDir          52 bytes
        LastFile1        65 bytes
        LastFile2        65 bytes
        DefExt            4 bytes
        BoldOnBuff       32 bytes
        BoldOffBuff      32 bytes
        UnderOnBuff      32 bytes
        UnderOffBuff     32 bytes
        PrintInitCodes  128 bytes
        PrintTermCodes  128 bytes
        ASCIILeftMargin   2 bytes
        ASCIIRightMargin  2 bytes

Another thing worth pointing out: if you prefer a different "blink rate"
for the cursor (in Memo, only) simply change the value of CursorBlink.  It's
the number of 1/18ths seconds that the cursor is on/off.  If set to 0, the
cursor won't blink at all.  Most of the rest is of minimal use.  Muck with at
your own risk.

NOTE: the above (the bold/underline on/off override buffers) were included as a
"work-around" method of supporting other printer types besides those built into
the ROM.  It can also be used to turn bold and/or underline into other kinds of
character attributes (like italics) if you prefer those and your printer
supports them with escape sequences or control codes.
