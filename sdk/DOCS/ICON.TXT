The .ICN files need to have the SAME name & path as the .EXE file for which
they are to serve as an icon.  (This is unfortunate for the programs on the
ROM disk, as it's not possible to add custom icons for them because of
this.)

The format of the .ICN file is a simple G_PutImage structure as I've
explained to you before, with a width of 44 and a height of 32 (decimal).
The .ICN files generated here by the AppManager guru also have some junk on
the end of the file, but it's unused by the AppManager itself.  It's for use
with the ICON EDITOR that he wrote which is, in his own words, "a piece of
shit" which requires TKERNEL and CGAGRAPH to run.  There's a good chance
that he'll rewrite it someday, but he's not to keen on distributing it as
is.  It should be simple enough for an adequate programmer, however, to
throw an ICON editor together (knowing the above information) using the HP
100LX or a PC and a copy of CGAGRAPH, so that the low-level graphics could
be used to do the G_GetImage.

The AppManager checks to make sure that the first 8 bytes of the file are
PRECISELY:  0x01 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x2c 0x00 0x20 0x00
That's the only check made to verify the file contents (other than the file
name and path, of course).
