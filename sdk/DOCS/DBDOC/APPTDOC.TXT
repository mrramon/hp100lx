APPOINTMENT BOOK OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The appointment book data records are of a fixed format.
For the appointment book data records, there are several types:
 * Non-repeating appointments
 * Repeating appointments
 * Non-repeating todos
 * Repeating todos
 * Checked off Repeating todo

The items that are non-repeating are referred to as single-occurrence
items.  Repeating items are called multi-occurrence items.

The appointment book has two special records of record type 14 (TYPE_USER).
Record 0 of TYPE_USER has the Appointment book info structure.  This holds
information about the data records and appointment book defaults.

Record 1 of TYPE_USER has the Single Occurence Table.  This holds a date 
sorted list of records to help the appointment book keep track of what 
single occurring (non-repeating) appointments and todos are on each day. 
There are SglOccurDayCount (in above record) items, and each one 
contains the date and record number of that item:

Array of SglOccurDayCount * {
  0..2    Date (Year, Month, Day)  See other document for format of bytes
  3..4    Record Number    int
  }
The table's last has an indeterminate date and Record Number=-1.



The appointment book keeps track of the time order of records by using 
three types of linked lists.  The first list is given by the Single 
Occurrence Table (above).  Each entry in the Single Occurrence table is 
the head of a doubly-linked list of records for that day.  Each chain is 
sorted so that Events are first, then all appointments (sorted in 
ascending time order), then any todo's (only single occurrence 
todos; checked-off or todo's without carry over).  A visual example:

  ---------   ------------------------   --------------------------
  5/18/1992                        2
  1/29/1993                        53
  2/16/1993                        78 <=> 4 <=> 5 <=> 82
  2/23/1993                        70
  2/30/1993                        62
  3/15/1993                        12

  3/26/1993                        5

  4/1/1993                         8
  4/19/1993                        3
  4/21/1993                        20 <=> 66
  4/24/1993                        65
  4/25/1993                        74
  5/1/1993                         72

  ?/?/?                            -1     END OF TABLE

Next, all the multi-occurrence items are linked together in one long 
doubly-linked chain.  The head of the chain is given in the ApptBook 
Info structure FirstRptRecNo field.  These aren't sorted in any 
particular order, since the Apptbook internally generates the repeating 
occurrences, and interleaves them as necessary.

The next linked list is for each todo with checked-off or deleted 
occurrences (aka stubs).  The "spawner", or todo that originated the 
stubs has a list of the dates of those records at its end. The stubs 
have separate records as well, and the spawner points to the last of
those.

****This should be maintained as an occurrence such that the 
  following occurrence is beyond 'today'.  Occurrences
  prior to this date are not to be displayed by this record.
  When carry-forward is enabled, the to-do carries over from
  this date to 'today'; no other instances of this repeat
  are concerned with carry-forward.

  If the current occurrence is checked-off, this date is
  bumped to show the next occurrence.  If some other future
  occurrence is checked-off, in addition to creating an
  independent instance of the completed task, it must be
  logged in this record as a deleted instance.  Deleted instances
  can be removed from the record when the date stored in the
  Origination Date field moves beyond them.
