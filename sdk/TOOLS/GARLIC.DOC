GARLIC User's Guide 1.1
========================

What is GARLIC?
---------------
GARLIC is a 100LX database reconstructor.  It works by scanning a
corrupt database for anything it can recognize as still valid records.
It then outputs those, along with reconstructed tables and links, into a
new file for you to examine and edit. (Although not written explicitly
for the Omnibook, it should work on corrupt Omnibook files as well.)
GARLIC WILL NOT WORK ON PASSWORDED FILES.


When do I use GARLIC?
---------------------
Since GARLIC performs various mutilations on a file to make it readable,
I would not recommend using it unless there is no other recourse.  That
is, if you suddenly get a "Record Not Found" message (or something
similar) on opening your only copy of a cherished vegetable database,
this would be a good time.  If do you have a backup, the strategy I
would recommend is to use GARLIC to retrieve all your new info, but
merge it into your existing backup.


Why do I need to use GARLIC?
----------------------------
Or, why is my database corrupt?  There are several known
causes for this:
  1) Rebooting machine *in the middle of a database operation*.
     Note that rebooting the machine while it is idle and
     waiting for a key is not a problem.
  2) Having the machine die (battery failure) in the middle
     of a database operation.  Like above, if the database is
     open, but idle, this isn't a problem.  Since accessing
     cards (especially Flash EPROM) draws significantly more
     power than just idleing, these two events are more than
     just statistically related, however.
  3) Breaking a connection with a database file while it is
     open over a remote redirector, i.e., the built-in
     redirector, DOS 6's Interlink, or Lap Link.  There also
     seems to be a class of bug common with redirectors that can
     cause file corruption in certain circumstances, especially
     if the connection is ended abnormally.
  4) Using any type of binary filter on the file.  For example,
     doing a file FTP but forgetting to use BINARY mode, or
     loading the file into most word processors or text
     editors and saving.  Editors have a tendency to mutilate
     lots of special characters that can be present in a
     binary file.  The built-in Memo program is no exception
     to this--loading and editing, or just loading the file
     when autosave will destroy the file beyond GARLICing.
     For most of these cases, the file has lost most of the
     significant information to be able to reconstruct the
     file.  You can give GARLIC a try, but my guess is that
     a backup will be your only recourse.
  5) Beserk programs.  Portions of the database are held
     in memory (namely the lookup table and database header)
     and are written back to disk at times.  Programs (either
     DOS or System Manager compliant) that are buggy can
     potentially write into incorrect locations in memory,
     and collide with these data structures.  Although
     the likelihood is probably not high (since these programs
     probably will also crash the machine), they could corrupt
     a database.
  5) As yet unfound bugs.  Hopefully these will be few and
     far between (as they have been so far), but like any
     piece of reasonably complicated software, the possibility
     does exist.


How do I use GARLIC?
--------------------
It's relatively simple.  Suppose your database FRED.PDB is
corrupt and won't load.  At DOS, type:
  GARLIC FRED.PDB FRED_FIX.PDB
The first name is the corrupt file, and the second name is
the file it will recreate.  The two filenames MUST be
different--GARLIC needs to refer to the corrupt file as it
creates the reconstructed file.

If you are running GARLIC on the 100LX, you may need to
terminate the System Manager or use the Filer DOS option
to get enough memory.  GARLIC allocates several large buffers
during reconstruction.

After running it, you should see a bunch of diagnostic messages,
then the program will terminate.  If you would like to see
in more detail what is happening, use the /D switch (for
example, GARLIC /D FRED.ADB FRED_FIX.ADB).  This is the
DEBUG (or DEVELOPER, to suit your fancy) switch, and outputs
all the changes being made to the file.  You'll probably
want to redirect this into a file, as it is usually quite
large.

NOTE: Using the /D switch does not affect the resulting
database, only the messages printed.  If you don't want to
see a lot of clutter, don't use it, and you'll still get
the same performance.

A more drastic step is to use the /V switch.  This will remove
all your subsetting information, and create a default subset.
This is more likely to make the file open properly, but you'll
lose all the defined subsets.


Steps to take after GARLICing a file
------------------------------------
1) The first thing to do after GARLICing a file is to try to
open the newly reconstructed copy (FRED_FIX in the above
example).

If it doesn't open, DON'T DESPAIR YET!  Try rerunning GARLIC with
the /V switch.  This switch was added in GARLIC 1.1 to remove all
existing subsets, and create a default subset.  I observed this
to often be the only thing keeping the file from opening, and using
/V will often clear up the problem.  Try opening the file again (if
it opens, you'll have to add all your subsets back).

If it still won't open, the file was so severly
trashed that nothing could save it (especially since it
does a better job fixing files than I can do manually!).
(NOTE: If you can't open the file, you could try GARLICing
the "fixed" file.  On at least one occassion, I've observed
this to actually work!)

2) If the file does open, look around for obviously bad info
(like strings of random garbage), and delete them. If you notice
any missing information, you might want to jot those entries
down (don't enter them just yet).  If you're lucky, and the
file was minorly corrupt, you might have all your data and
no garbage records.  Consider yourself fortunate (and remember
to back up your file!).  In general, the worse the corruption,
the more missing or irrelevant information your file will
have.  GARLIC attempts to reconstruct the structure of the
database, but it can't patch garbage in the data itself.

3) Create an empty file, and merge in the fixed file.  This
allows either the database or appointment book a chance to
fix up any remaining things that GARLIC might not have
corrected.  If you cannot do this step (you get additional
"Record Not Found" messages), you may need to go back to
the fixed file and try to view the card view of each record
in succession.  If you can't view a record, you should delete
it.

If you have a recent backup, you might try deleting all the
"old" info from the fixed file (so that file only has records
entered or modified since the backup was made), and merge that
fixed file into your backup file.

4) Manually add back any records you noticed were missing in
steps 1-3.  If you have notes that are missing, you can get
a copy of them by re-running GARLIC with the /D switch.
Embedded in the output are the contents of any unattached notes
that GARLIC deleted.  With some cutting and pasting you
should be able to re-insert them.

5) Back your file up in a safe place.  I can't answer how
rigorous you should be about this, but you might ask yourself
the following questions: How often do I change my data (hourly,
daily, weekly)?  What would I do if I lost my data?  How
expensive would losing my data be?  How accessible do I
need my backups should anything unfortunate occur?  How does the
inconvience of a backup weigh against the inconvience of
reconstructing lost data.

If you're using GARLIC for the first time, you can probably
answer some of these questions.  You should consider keeping
recent backups of sensitive data on a RAM/Flash card and/or
on your PC.

If you make nightly or very frequent backups, you should be
careful about the effect I call "cascaded corruption".  That
is, if you back up a corrupted file, you now have (ta-da)
*two* corrupted files!  The only way to get around this is to
1) make sure your files are okay before backing them up, or
2) keep more than one backup (perhaps one for every day of the
week?).

NOTE: The other important thing to be aware of is that there is a bug
related to opening a file that has been copied but has no subset/sort
order.  Mostly, this will be an appointment book, but a database/phone
book with no sort item selected will also show it.  This bug shows up
infrequently, but may damage the file when you open it. Because of this,
I would recommend that any nightly backups use a macro that first closes
out all database apps (AppMgr/Close All is the easiest way to do this)
before making the backup.

You should carefully think about a backup strategy that works
for you.


Conclusion
----------
I hope that you never have to use this program.  If you
do need to use it, I hope it works for you!  Good Luck!
