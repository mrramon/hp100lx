This program was designed for HP 100 users running DOS applications
that tend to leave files open on a card in drive A.  A problem
occurs after the machine is turned off and back on--an error is generated
when they try to access their open files on drive A.

What the TSR does, is attach itself to the device driver (CARDDRV)
so that it can override the result of calls to the device driver
that ask if the media has changed.  This call expects one of three
answers: yes, no, or maybe.  The TSR changes an answer of "yes, the
media has changed" to be "well, maybe the media has changed".  This
allows the system to check further for information about a possible
media change and eliminates the "Invalid Media Change" message.

This program removes a certain degree of bullet-proofing that guarantees
that true media-change events are detected.  Therefore, the user should
attempt to guarantee that the media doesn't actually change while files
are open or corruption of the memory card is a possiblity.

To start it up, execute FIXEDA.COM from the C: prompt or from a batch
file.  To remove it, invoke it again using the '/u' option.

The memory resident size is 352 bytes.
