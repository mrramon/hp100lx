UNDEAD is a utility that will reverse translate
a DDT dump of a file and create a database file from it.  This
helps a lot in reconstructing/patching databases 

Example of how to use:

Run DDT on the offending DB file, and redirect to a text file:
   
   DDT JUNK.PDB>TEMP.TMP

The file can be edited to fix suspect items--patching values,
deleting records, etc.  Note that only the hex representation is
used in reconstructing.  The alpha off to the side is ignored.
The original position in the file doesn't matter, only lines
that look like      000000: 00 00 00 00 
are used, and are written out in the order they occur (so reordering
the file is possible without adjusting the 6 digit file position on
the left margin).

Now run UNDEAD on the file, giving the text file and name of the
desired output database:
  
   UNDEAD TEMP.TMP FIXED.PDB

Voila!  You have a new and improved database.
