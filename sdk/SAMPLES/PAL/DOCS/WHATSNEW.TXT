What's new in V1.1  ?
=====================

Here's a list of new stuff in this V1.1 update:

UTILITIES:
----------

+ NG2HTML permits conversion of the PAL reference docs to HTML
format (the format used on the World-Wide Web). View it with
your favorite viewer on the desktop (NetScape, Cello, Mosaic),
or with ...

+ HV - the HTML hypertext viewer/browser for the palmtop

+ PFE, the PAL font editor can edit and convert fonts in Vertical
Reader VFN, PAL HFN, or FCL file format.


DOCUMENTATION:
--------------

There is now a single README.TXT in the PAL 'root' directory -
so that it should catch your eye. The other files have been
moved to the .\DOCS directory. The much-awaited OVERVIEW.TXT
is now here. The documentation of the various modules (under .\SRC)
has been checked and updated. On popular demand, support for the
standard Norton guide tools is back - check out MAKENG.BAT under
.\UTIL\NG.


FUNCTIONS:
----------

A number of additions, especially on the 'easier user interface'
front:

 - MenuSelect: present a picklist to the user, return index
 - MsgBox: powerful message dialog with optional buttons and
   an optional input line, all in one call without structures
 - AskYesNo: for those "are you sure you want to FORMAT C:"
   type questions.
 - KeyWaiting: detect if a key has been pressed or is waiting
   in the PAL 'PushKeys' input queue
 - MsDelay: wait a specified number of milliseconds
 - SaveState and RestoreState: get and set the graphics state


MISCELLANEOUS:
--------------

 - bug fixes in some modules
 - scrollbars in scrolling menues
 - Auto-load CGAGRAPH support on the desktop
   (see the README.TXT file under .\UTIL\TSR)
 - state management now implemented
 - the NG directory moved to the .\UTIL tree.



What's new in V1.0  ?
=====================

This is the first 'official' PAL release - it should now be stable and
documented enough that you can start building applications with it.

The single new thing in 1.0 - besides a few bug fixes and more complete
documentation, is dialogs - see .\SRC\DIALOG\DIALOG.DOC for a description
of what is available.

Note that:

- no libraries are included in this version to keep the archive size
small. First install the PM utility as described in .\UTIL\PM\PM.DOC,
then build the libs for your compiler by changing to the .\SRC directory
and entering PM [RETURN].

- the MENU structure changed to allow for scrollable menues. See PAL.H and
the sample source (under .\SAMPLES\MENU\MENU.C) for details. The last
'terminator' item in the menu item array is no longer required.
OTOH, the menu structure now has these fields:

   typedef struct {
      PALWIN *pMnuWin;     /* a menu has an associated window */
      WORD Flags;          /* flags: kind of menu */
      int CurItem;         /* currently selected item */
      int TopItem;         /* first visible item in menu (NEW) */
      int ItmDisp;         /* number of visible items (NEW) */
      int ItmCount;        /* total number of items (NEW) */
      MENUITEM *Items;     /* array of items */
   } MENU;

If you want a standard, non-scrolling menu, set TopItem to zero, and ItmDisp
and ItmCount to the number of elements in your item array. (Which should
NOT contain any terminator element at this moment)

- radio buttons in dialogs have a slightly different behaviour than their
SM counterpart.

What's new in V0.41 ?
=====================

0.41 introduces a numbering scheme - the fourth upload
got christened 0.40, and this one is 0.41. It adds
compiled ready-to-use libraries for MSC and MIX Power C.

The ICNVU sample is now included in a compiled version,
as a demo for those who want to see what is possible with PAL
right now.

What's new in V0.40 ?
=====================

While dialogs didn't quite make it into this version, this
release has much better documentation and a number of new
samples and utilities.

UTILITIES:
----------

  PAL MAKE
  --------
  or PM in short, makes it easier to create the PAL
  libraries for your compiler, compile PAL samples, and even
  compile your own programs that you write with PAL. No
  bothering with makefiles - if your compiler is supported,
  all that you have to do is tell PM where PAL is located on
  your drives, and what compiler you have. Compilers currently
  supported by PM are Borland C, Microsoft C, Turbo C, Quick C
  and Mix Power C.

  See .\UTIL\PM\PM.DOC, or refer to the corresponding section
  under 'Utilities' in the Norton Guide.


  HFN Fonts
  ---------
  The .\UTIL\HFN directory now contains a complete collection of
  proportional fonts. See .\UTIL\HFN\FILELIST.TXT.


  VFN2HFN
  -------
  courtesy of Harry Konstas, there's a font converter now that
  can convert VR 'VFN' fonts into the HFN font format used by
  PAL. See .\UTIL\VFN2HFN\VFN2HFN.DOC.

  MKBIN
  -----
  allows easy inclusion of binary data like bitmaps, icons or
  fonts, into your C sources - see .\UTIL\MKBIN\MKBIN.DOC

  PCX2IMG
  -------
  can convert PCX files to IMG files and icons (for use with
  LoadImg, PutImg etc.). Check .\UTIL\PCX2IMG\PCX2IMG.DOC, or
  the corresponding section in the PAL Norton Guide.


SAMPLES:
--------

  ICNVU
  -----
  This is an actual useful program: a shell for your icon editor
  and a viewer for your icon collection as well. Illustrates
  usage of a number of various PAL modules, instead of focusing
  on just one. No documentation file yet, but should be easy to
  use. Check ICNVU.CFG to customize the icon editor and the icon
  directories that ICNVU should check.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

  Lots of new documentation - in addition to what was present in
  upload #3, here's the list of the modules that are now
  extensively documented.

  - Proportional font routines
  - Lowlevel graphics routines
  - Highlevel graphics routines
  - Miscellaneous functions
  - System manager access support
  - Window functions

  This makes the docs to about 95% complete.

  - We now also have a Copyright statement, thanks to Ron Crain.
  Can be found in COPYRITE.TXT in the PAL root directory.

  - PAL.NG, the Pal Norton guide, now has a 'Utilities' menu
  where you can directly access the documentation of the various
  utilities included with PAL.

  - .\NG\NGREADME.TXT, contributed by Dave Vickers, explains
  what Norton Guides are all about, lists two good viewers (a
  commercial and a shareware one) and also contains an
  interesting group purchase deal that Dave worked out with one
  of the suppliers.


MISCELLANEOUS
-------------

   There's out-of-range checking for menus now

   The SAMPLES directory moved: it is no more under .\SRC. This
   is cleaner, especially in view of a 'user version' of PAL
   that doesn't include all the source code.

   The MAKEFILE directory is no more - it got supplemented by PM.

   There's a new ShowFKeys function in HIGRAPH that permits to
   display function labels at the bottom of the screen.

   The new CheckSysMgr function (in the MISC module) allows to
   test for SysMgr presence. The SOUND and CBCP sample programs
   now check this and won't crash any more if launched without
   SysMgr loaded.

   PAL.H now has a MENU_KEY constant.

   The handling of resident fonts has been improved. (See ICNVU
   or FONT samples)

   The Norton Guide batch file now creates error files - useful if
   there are unresolved hyperlinks.


BUG FIXES
---------
   - Corrected bug in LoadImg (missing fclose)
   - corrected small bug in fontload.c
   - fixed a bug in LoadPcx (didn't set .Planes and .Bits in IMGHDR)
   - fixed a bug in SaveImg (saved rubbish)
   - fixed a bug in CBCP (wrote a zero byte to output)
