=================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS:

System Manager Compliant programming is supported by HP only in
Microsoft C Ver. 6.00. All others C and other language programming
environments are not supported.

ISV.EXE is a self-extracting executable. In order to decompress it,
copy it into a directory, go to that directory and do

	ISV -d 

The -d option builds the subdirectories that are needed. They are important.

Some of the directories include .ZIP files. Each of these is a 
set of related files and are compressed, so that second and 
third levels of subdirectories are not built during 
decompression of ISV.EXE.  These .ZIP files were compressed 
using PKZIP. See the TOOLS directory for more.
===================================================================
TECHNICAL SUPPORT: 

There is no support directly from HP for this documentation or its use.

The developer support is done on Compuserve in the HPHAND forum by the
community of software and hardware developers.  

HP technical support personnel are occasional members of that community, 
but are not the primary resource.  Please direct any questions to the 
community in general (i.e "ALL"), not specifcally to HP or SYSOP. 

The file PAL.ZIP is the result of the work of this community.  It is an
ongoing project.  For the latest version, Go HPHAND, Programmers Library.
