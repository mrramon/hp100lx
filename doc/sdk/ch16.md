# 16\. Working with the IC

## Power Management

The power management circuitry controls the transitions between the modes shown in the table below. The VDD supply can operate in one of 2 modes, low power or high power. The low frequency oscillator (LFO) is always enabled.

Mode        | Vcc Supply | CPU Clock | Display | Timer Clock | HFO
------------|------------|-----------|---------|-------------|----
Static      | -          | OFF       | OFF     | OFF         | OFF
Deep Sleep  | OFF        | OFF       | OFF     | OFF         | OFF
Light Sleep | ON         | OFF       | ON      | ON          | ON
Operating   | ON         | ON        | ON      | ON          | ON
Backup      | OFF        | OFF       | OFF     | OFF         | OFF

### Static Test Condition

The static test condition is entered only during test. This mode is used to measure static leakage current. In this mode the part has been reset and no clocks are being driven. The low frequency oscillator (LFO) is held inactive externally.

### Deep Sleep

Deep sleep is entered from operating mode when software sets the SHT bit with the DON bit cleared. The system will exit deep sleep and begin operating when an enabled interrupt is received. The timer, UART, and the display do not operate during deep sleep and therefore cannot wake-up the system. (RX and RI can wake the system even though the UART is shutdown.) Also, low power interrupt and module pulled interrupt should be disabled by software before entering deep sleep.

### Light Sleep

Light sleep is entered from operating mode when software sets the SHT bit with the DON bit set. Any enabled interrupt source will cause an exit from light sleep to operating mode.

### Operating

Operating mode can be entered from either of the other two modes. If it is being entered from deep sleep then the Hornet chip will pause for 35ms after requesting high power mode from the external supply. Following this delay the CPU will begin operation at the reset vector (ffff0h) with interrupts disabled by the CPU reset.

When software is finished processing, it may exit operating mode and enter either light sleep or deep sleep. Light sleep is entered by setting the SHT bit. Deep sleep is entered by first clearing the DON bit, then setting the SHT bit. The CPU will prefetch several instructions following the instruction that sets the SHT bit. This requires that several NOP instructions follow setting the SHT bit. When operating mode is again entered, hardware will clea r the SHT bit. It is up to software to control the state of the DON bit.

### Backup

The external power supply indicates the state of the VDD and VCC supplies on the VDDOK and VCCOK lines. If either of these lines goes low while in light sleep or operating modes, Hornet will cause an NMI. The operating system must use this NMI to quickly shut the system down in deep sleep. Once in deep sleep with VDDOK or VCCOK low, Hornet will force the power supply into backup mode.

If the system is in deep sleep or in the process of powering up, and VDDOK or VCCOK go low, Hornet will immediately force backup mode. The system will remain in backup mode until the ON key is pressed.

VDDOK and VCCOK are de-glitched internally using the 32KHz oscillator.

### Wakeups

If enabled, an interrupt source can cause a wakeup from light sleep or deep sleep. In order to cause a wakeup, the wakeup source must be valid for 50us. After a wakeup, the system will ignore shutdown attempts for 15us.

### System Resets

The Hornet chip will be reset when:

* Power is first applied (Power-On-Reset (POR) circuit), or a logic low level is driven on the NRES pad. This reset will be held until VDDOK = 1 and VCCOK = 1.
* The keyboard circuitry senses that the ON pad, KBI[22], and KBI[23] are all high for a 7.8ms debounce time (ON/SHIFT/CNTRL keys depressed).

A reset will cause the system to:

1. Execute the power-up sequence if asleep,
2. Reset the CPU, and
3. Enter operating mode.

### System Control Register

The System Control register controls the system mode and also contains several miscellaneous control bits. The System Control register is located at index -1Eh and is defined as follows:

```
Bit   Reset Value   R/W Mode   Description

                               the CPU.  The system enters light sleep mode if the
                               DON bit is set and will enter deep sleep mode if the
                               DON bit is clear.  This bit is set only, it is
                               automatically cleared by a wakeup.

[1]   0             R/W        BUP - Backup; This status bit is set when the system
                               has been in backup mode.  It should be cleared by software

                               10 - medium (5V)
                               11 - loud (8V)
```

### System Status Register

The System Status register contains information that is used by software to manage power consumption and also contains the RST bit used to force a hardware reset. The System Status register is located at index -1Fh and is defined as follows:

```
Bit      Value     Mode     Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[0]      1         R/W      UART Access; This bit is set each time software reads or
                            writes to any register in the UART. Cleared by writing a zero

[1]      1         R/W      Display Buffer Access; This bit is set each time software
                            reads or writes the display video RAM, and is cleared by
                            writing a zero.

[2]      1         R/W      Display Register Access; This bit is set each time software
                            reads or writes any PC MDA/CGA compatible register in the
                            Display Controller and is cleared by writing a zero.

[3]      1         R/W      External IO; This bit is set each time software reads or
                            writes an IO register that does not map to a location
                            internal to the Hornet chip.  These accesses are routed
                            to the MD bus and include the IO window as well as unmapped
                            accesses.

[4]      1         R/W      PC peripheral IO Access; This bit is set by a read or write
                            access of the PC-compatible peripherals on the Hornet chip,
                            including the 8254, 8255, and 8259.  This bit is cleared by
                            writing a zero.

[5]      -         -        unused

[6]      -         -        unused

[7]      0         R/W      RHO - Reset Has Occurred; This bit is cleared by a system
                            reset.  It should be initialized to a 1 by a warm start.```
```

## Special Hardware Considerations

This section details hardware features that need special consideration when using the Hornet IC.

### Power-Fail Wakeup

A power-fail event (i.e. VDDOK or VCCOK low) will not cause a wakeup even if this interrupt is enabled. This will cause problems in light sleep (shutdown with display on) since software must be active to respond to a power-fail event by entering deep sleep (shutdown with display off) before the hardware can enter backup mode.

On the palmtop product, this problem was solved by creating a signal on the PCB called "PSF" that is the logical NAND of VDDOK and VCCOK. PSF is connected to Hornet's GPIO13 pin. Before entering light sleep, software enables interrupts and wakeups on a high level of GPIO13. In the event of a power fail, GPIO13 will cause a light sleep wakeup and allow the normal power-fail NMI to take effect.

### GPIO[24:26] Interrupt Source Bits

The GPIO[24:26] Interrupt Source (ISR) bits located at index -5B are different from other Hornet ISR bits. It is not necessary to clear these bits before another interrupt occurs. This was done to allow standard applications to operate without knowledge of the Hornet ISR bits. This difference can cause problems if GPIO[24:26] pins are configured to cause interrupts on an IRQ line that is shared with other sources. The easiest work around is to simply not share interrupts on GPIO[24:26] and ignore the corresponding ISR bits.

The problem of using GPIO[24:26] on shared IRQ lines is described below. For this problem description, "GPIO active" means that the GPIO interrupt is enabled and it's level matches the sense bit. Note that this could occur due to changes in the GPIO level or changes to these bits.

1. The GPIO goes to the active state and causes an interrupt.
2. The GPIO line then goes inactive before or after the interrupt service routine begins.
3. The PIC interrupt pending bit will be cleared when the interrupt service routine begins. This readies the PIC for another interrupt on the same IRQ line.
4. The GPIO line then goes active for a second time. This sets the PIC interrupt pending bit, but has no effect on the Hornet ISR bit since it is still set from the first time it went active.
5. Software in the interrupt service routine clears the Hornet ISR bit and returns from interrupt.
6. Since the PIC has a second interrupt pending for the same IRQ line, another interrupt occurs. Since the Hornet ISR bit is not set, the interrupt service routine does not know which interrupt to service. Even worse, if the GPIO line stays active (due to not being serviced), it masks all other sources on the IRQ line. No more interrupts will occur on this IRQ line until the GPIO line goes inactive.

To solve this problem, the software within the interrupt service routine should disable the interrupt before clearing the ISR bit. The interrupt can then be re-enabled afterwards. This will guarantee that the ISR bit will be set when a second interrupt occurs.

### ON Key Input

During keyboard scanning, it is possible for other key lines to capacitively couple into the ON key input line and cause glitches. Because of the way the ON key is de-glitched, a continuous stream of glitches can prevent Hornet from recognizing a change in state. This problem should be prevented by inserting a 16ms delay between key scans in order to allow the ON key state to be properly recognized.

## Testing

A test pad (NTEST) has been included to force the part into test mode. The following sections are be implemented as macro-cells and are tested using the appropriate off-the-shelf test program:

* The 80C186 CPU core
* The 8254 PIT
* The 8259 PIC
* The 16450 UART
* The GAHAN DAC
* The 2 80x16 RAM blocks

The remaining blocks are tested using custom test programs.

The XCPU pin allows the internal CPU to be disabled. This allows for direct access to internal circuitry by driving external bus cycles. GPIO provides an external clock input in this mode.

There are two major test modes, DA test mode and HP test mode. In HP test mode the NRES pad is inactive and the NTEST pad active. Most HP mode testing will occur with the chip in XCPU mode to allow access that is direct as possible to the HP designed blocks on the chip. DA test mode connects a specified macro cell to the chip pads for direct access testing. All DA testing is done with the NRES and NTEST pads active.

States for the NTEST and NRES pads are listed below.

State            | NRES | NTEST
-----------------|------|------
DA TEST MODE     | 0    | 0
RESET            | 0    | 1
HP TEST MODE     | 1    | 0
NORMAL OPERATION | 1    | 1

Clock pad bypass, forcing of the ONST on state signal, and refresh disable are provided by a three-bit register that is loaded on the falling edge of NTEST. This register is only used in HP test mode and is reset when NRES=0. The the pin assignments for loading the register are:

Function        | Pad   | Bit Name
----------------|-------|---------
BYPASS OSC.     | KBI22 | BYPASS
FORCE ON STATE  | KBI23 | FONST
DISABLE REFRESH | ON    | NERFSH

When the BYPASS bit is set the NDSR pad is used instead of HXI for high frequency clock input, and the NDCD pad is used instead of LXI for low frequency clock input. When the FONST bit is set, the ONST "on state" signal is forced active inside the Hornet chip. When the NERFSH bit is set, no refresh cycles will occur.

When in DA test mode, the contents of the TSEL register determine what DA macro-cell is under test. TSEL data is loaded through the pads listed in the table below. TSEL bit 6 is used for only one purpose, as an input to the 186 CPU core. The TSEL register is clocked and selected by the KBI22, KBI23, and ON pads. When KBI22=0 and KBI23=0, data will be clocked in on the rising edge of ON. One possible procedure for loading data into the register is:

1. Set KBI22, KBI23 to 1, set NRES, ON to 0. Set the TSEL register pads to the desired values.
2. Set NTEST to 0. At this point the MITE mode will be selected.
3. Set KBI22 and KBI23 to 0.
4. Set ON to 1.
5. At this point, the TSEL register will contain the value set on the TSEL register input pads.
